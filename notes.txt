---- MARKING RUBRIC ----

.5 - Compiles & Runs
- Yeahhh boi

Behavioural Design Pattern
- State: handle game state & player state (using switch statemets, too much coupling)
- Memento: save and restore levels from checkpoints

1.0 - Code Quality

1.0 - Configurable # of lives
- Lives configureable in config file

1.0 - Level Restarts on loss of life
- Enemies restart
- Player returns to starting x coordinate

1.0 - Scoring system
- score increments at a slower rate
- +100 points when object is 'killed' from above
- +1000 multiplied by current level when level is completed


1.0 - Preservation of previous functionality
- *takes glasses off* YEAHHHHHHHHHHH

0.75 - User controls stickman (0.75)
- Done & done

1.0 - Multiple Levels
- 2 Levels at the moment. Half obstacles specified are stage 1, other half are stage 2
- Level1: Cacti moves at same speed as background
- Level2+: Birds with configurable velocity
- Game speeds up with each level but user stays the same

Memory efficient design

0.75 - Powerups
- Get a powerup by 'killing' an enemy
- Toggle through each size mode
- This is designed to be used as a strategy as different modes will have different powers
-- Giant cannot jump but is indestructable: as a result scoring is slower, still gets pushed back each time
--> Large has an extra jump
--> Tiny is smaller and can fit in smaller spaces
--> Normal (well thats just normal)

1.75 - Sensible Testing Framework
- stage 3 collision testing
- giant walking through enemies
- kill obstacles by jumping on them
- changing modes / sizes
- checking set and getters for number of lives work

Extensions
- Gain / lose space (ie pushed back by enemies or push them back)
-- fed into game mechanic (can lose by getting pushed back to far or win early by reaching the end, stickman can pass level before all obstacles are complete by reaching the end)
- Stage 1 code preserved (ie different types obstacles for level 1 & for level 2)


Total so far (7.25)
