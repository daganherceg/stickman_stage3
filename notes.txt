---- A few updates to the code ----

Collisions
- Move back when colliding
- Move to next level when colliding with right wall

---- MARKING RUBRIC ----

.5 - Compiles & Runs
- Yeahhh boi

Behavioural Design Pattern

1.0 - Code Quality

1.0 - Configurable # of lives
- Lives configureable in config file

1.0 - Level Restarts on loss of life
- Enemies restart
- Player returns to starting x coordinate

1.0 - Scoring system
- score increments at a slower rate
- +100 points when object is 'killed' from above
- +1000 multiplied by current level when level is completed


1.0 - Preservation of previous functionality
- *takes glasses off* YEAHHHHHHHHHHH

0.75 - User controls stickman (0.75)
- Done & done

1.0 - Multiple Levels
- 2 Levels at the moment. Half obstacles specified are stage 1, other half are stage 2
- Level1: Cacti moves at same speed as background
- Level2+: Birds with configurable velocity
- Game speeds up with each level but user stays the same

Memory efficient design

Powerups
- Get a powerup by 'killing' an enemy
- Toggle through each size mode
- This is designed to be used as a strategy as different modes will have different powers
-- Giant cannot jump but is indestructable: as a result scoring is slower
-- Large has an extra jump
-- Tiny is smaller and can fit in smaller spaces
-- Normal (well thats just normal)

Sensible Testing Framework
-

Extensions
- Win/lose logic (not in marking rubric)
- Win / lose space (ie pushed back by enemies or push them back)


Total so far (7.25)
